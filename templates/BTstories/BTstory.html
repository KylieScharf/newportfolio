            1:"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For decades, people have been trying to solve the mysteries within the Bermuda Triangle where ships, planes, and even people have disappeared & went off the radar completely. You turn on your TV and hear a news broadcast talking about another mysterious disappearance involving a wealthy couple on a yacht. The incident happened in Southern Florida when the young couple decided to cruise farther east, where they unwillingly entered the Bermuda Triangle. Coast Guard security gets involved and spends the next 12 hours searching the coasts of Florida, but couldn’t Identify the yacht the young couple took out from the harbor. This story suddenly becomes the news highlight for months, where they have been missing ever since. One of the families of the couple has offered a $500,000 dollar reward for whoever is able to find the couple and bring them back safely. You believe that you can solve the mystery and beat the risks, so you give it a shot.",
            11:"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your egoistic self believes you have what it takes to enter the Bermuda triangle alone. As promised by the young couple’s family, you have been supplied with a boat to begin the search. After three days at sea, you notice the weather starts to change and know that a heavy storm will hit you soon.",
            //12:"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have chosen to start a group search with one of your closest friends. The young couple’s family has supplied your search team with a boat and a firearm for both of you. Once you get on the boat and enter the Bermuda triangle, you notice something unusual coming towards your ship.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do you...",
            112:"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your boating skills came in handy and you have done just enough to survive the storm! However, when you wake up the next morning you see that you are no longer on the boat and have washed up ashore. You sit there wondering for a minute what happened and believe that at one point in time you have been knocked out by a powerful wave making you fully unconscious. You believe that your boat must be on this island because the last thing you remember is yourself steering the vessel through the thunderstorm. Your only way of communication is now your phone which thankfully still works. However, you have no service and can’t contact anyone. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the first thing you do?",

You immediately try to see if the com works so you can contact coast guard security but it doesn’t so you end up improvising and gathering as many valuable resources from the boat as you can. You have found a flare gun loaded with only 1 flare so you thought it would be a good idea to trace SOS on the sand and wait for the right moment to use the flare. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime what do you do?",
