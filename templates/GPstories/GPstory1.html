{% set para1 = "Built during a time when Egypt was one of the richest and most powerful civilizations in the world, the Great Pyramids of Giza are some of the most magnificent man-made structures in history. Their massive scale reflects the unique role that the pharaoh played in ancient Egyptian society. Inside of these pyramids, some of the world's most mysterious treasures lay, untouched for centuries. Your job is to retrieve the scarab jewel without triggering any of the booby traps. And most importantly, DON'T awaken the mummy of the Pharaoh of all Pharaohs, Khufu. You have the option to enter one of two pyramids. One of them is where the scarab jewel lays untouched, and the other is where you will meet your devastating end. Choose wisely." %}
