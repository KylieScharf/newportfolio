{% set para1 = "Hey! My name is Hamza Hakak, but you can call me Hamza (pronounced: Haum-zah). I am a current Del Norte senior. I was born in Dubai on September 10th, 2004. I lived in Dubai and Muscat, Oman, until the 5th grade. That's when I moved to The Golden State. I speak Arabic at home, and English at school. I am of arabic origin, and I enjoy arab things such as, foods, music, shows, literature, and the overall culture. I am interested in soccer, business, politics, and philosophy. In my free time I enjoy socializing with friends, studying, researching politics, researching business, and investing. I also love traveling. My favorite traveling destinations are Abu Dhabi, Muscat, and Doha. Some places that I really want to go to are Socotra and Baghdad. I am interested in a career in computer science, so I took this class. I plan on majoring in CS in college and my ultimate goal is to create a business revolving around this field. " %}
