{% set para1 = "Hello, my name is Kevin Chen. I was born in San Diego, California on February 25 2004. I grew up in the Rancho Bernardo area until I moved to 4s ranch around 5th grade. I am currently a Senior here at Del Norte. I am fluent in Chinese and English, but I primarily speak Chinese at home. I am proud of my Chinese culture, which is why I enjoy asian foods, traditions, and the Chinese language. I am primarily interested in basketball, technology and business. Some things that I enjoy doing are: playing PC games, hanging out with friends, eating good foods and traveling. The place that I like travelling to the most is Taiwan, since my grandparents live there, I enjoy eating the unique asian foods and going sightseeing. Some goals that I have in life is to pursue a degree in a technology related field or something to do with computers. The reason I took this class is that I was interested in learning about how to code, since I thought that it would be helpful to know how to code things. It is a good experience that I can use in college as well." %}
