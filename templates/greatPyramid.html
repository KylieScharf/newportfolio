It had a height of 480 feet and was 750 feet wide. It was built with 2.3 million stone blocks which each weighed anywhere from 2.5-15 tons. The second-largest pyramid was built by Khafare (Khufu’s son) in 2520 B.C. The necropolis that he built included a sphinx which had a body of a lion but the head of a pharaoh. The last pyramid was built by Menkaure in 2490 B.C which had the most complex mortuary temple. " %}
